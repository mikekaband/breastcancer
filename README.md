# **Breast Cancer Detection Report**

## **Introduction**

This project focuses on building a classification model to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The dataset contains 569 instances and 30 features that describe the characteristics of cell nuclei from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to contribute to healthcare applications by developing a diagnostic tool for early cancer detection.
